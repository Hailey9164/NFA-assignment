# NFA assignment for CSC 3110: Formal Languages and Automata
Design NFAs

1. Which problem(s) gave you the most trouble? Did you avoid any problem that is too challenging to finish by deadline? Did you ask questions to AI/instructor?

The most challenging problem for me was probibly #21  {string s| s ends with  10 },  because of the 'and'. I did nto ask any questions or avoid any problems. 

2.  Which problem(s) surprised you with a "gold-st-ring"? Which next state(s) did you not account for in the subset of next states? why? How to make sure you avoid such errors in your future flight/traffic/compiler state controller tasks, or in the near future, the course projects/exams?

The one problem where I had a gold-st-ring was #10 {string s| s doesn't contains substring 10 }, becuase I forgot to make the q0 state a final state. So, when I tested the string '00', I got a reject when I expected an accept. In future tasks, I will make sure to use test strings to ensure that the strings that should be accepted are and the ones that should be rejected are. 

3.  Other insights/comments/questions that you want the grader/instructor to know.

This assignment was pretty easy for me, and I only had the one problem with number 10 and had no other gold-st-rings. I did all of the problems because I wanted the extra practice, but realistically did not need it. Each problem took about 5 minutes to do, and that was only because of needing to take screenshots and make commits to GitHub. The actual designing of the NFAs only took about a minute.
