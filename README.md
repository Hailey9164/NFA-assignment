# NFA assignment for CSC 3110: Formal Languages and Automata
Design NFAs

1. Which problem(s) gave you the most trouble? Did you avoid any problem that is too challenging to finish by deadline? Did you ask questions to AI/instructor?


2.  Which problem(s) surprised you with a "gold-st-ring"? Which next state(s) did you not account for in the subset of next states? why? How to make sure you avoid such errors in your future flight/traffic/compiler state controller tasks, or in the near future, the course projects/exams?


3.  Other insights/comments/questions that you want the grader/instructor to know.
